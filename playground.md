    <summary>Summary:</summary>
    Conducted a literature review on the relationship between social media use and adolescent mental health. Divided reserach into correlational studies, longitudinal studies, and randomized experiments. Found that (1) heavy use of social media was consistantly associated with negative mental health outcomes among adolescents, especially girls; (2) the relationship is bi-directional with the forward direction (SM -> MH) being much stronger than the reverse direction (MH -> MH) and moderated by age and gender; and (3) experiments that introduce social media consistantly find adverse mental health outcomes, while experiments that remove social media depend on timeframe of mental health assessment: when mental health is assessed less than 4 weeks from removal, mental health is worse, but when assessed greater than 4 weeks from removal, mental health is improved.
