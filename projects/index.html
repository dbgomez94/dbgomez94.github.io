I'm a former Aerospace Engineer turned Machine Learning Engineer passionate about applying the tools of machine learning for social good. I conduct research at the intersection of machine learning, social media, and mental health, with a particular focus on suicidality. I'm currently seeking opportunities to leverage my skills in a way that has a positive societal impact. Feel free to reach out!
