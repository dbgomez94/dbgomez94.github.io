# From regression analysis to deep learning: development of improved proxy measures of state-level household gun ownership


## In Brief
In the absence of direct measurements of state-level household gun ownership, the quality and accuracy of proxy measures for this variable are essential for firearm-related research and policy development. In this work, we develop two significantly improved proxy measures of state-level household gun ownership via two methods: first using regression analysis, then using deep learning. We subject the new regression-based and deep-learning proxies to critical examination, and we benchmark our new proxies against existing ones for accuracy and validity.
