I develop **machine learning models** for **social good**. 

I'm an **MSCS** student at Georgia Tech specializing in **Machine Learning**. [My research](https://dbgomez94.github.io/pages/projects/) broadly focuses on the interaction between **Social Media** and **Mental Health**. I am a member of the [Social Dynamics and Well-Being Lab](https://socweb.cc.gatech.edu/) under the advisement of [Dr. Munmun De Choudhury](http://www.munmund.net/index.html). I will be receiving my (second) MS degree from Georgia Tech in December 2024.

I use the tools of machine learning to understand the bi-directional relationship between social media and mental health. On the one hand, our mental state can be expressed on and through social media -- and so some of the questions I'm interested in relate to understanding what mental health information can be gleaned from social media. On the other hand, social media may both positively and negatively affect our mental health.
