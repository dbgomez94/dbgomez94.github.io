## Overview

I'm currently a 2nD PhD student. My advisor recently passed away, so I'm somewhat of an orphan student looking for a new home. I was trained as an aerospace engineer, but soon fell in love with the field of data science and machine learning. My dream is to beceome a data scientist for social good. Towards this end, I've pursued a number of projects in the realm of public heath and social science.
