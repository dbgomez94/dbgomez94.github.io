## Overview

My name is David Gomez. I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning (MSCS-ML) at Georgia Tech. I received my BS and MS degrees in Aerospace Engineering from Georgia Tech during which my research focused on the fields of electric propulsion and satellite reliability. Throughout this time, I pursued a medley of machine learning passion projects that spanned fields of public health, public policy, and social issues. This work left a permanent impression on my heart, so much so that after a year working as an aerospace engineer, I have returned to GT for my MSCS-ML with the goal of applying machine learning for social good.
