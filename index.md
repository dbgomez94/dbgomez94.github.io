## Overview

I am a graduate student at Georgia Tech pursuing a Master's in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning. I am passionate about applying machine learning to solve social problems. I have experience in developing machine learning models for social media data to study mental health and social dynamics.

I'm currently seeking a full-time position as a Machine Learning Engineer or Data Scientist. I am open to opportunities in the tech industry, government, and non-profit organizations. I am particularly interested in working on projects that involve promoting mental health, combating human trafficking, and reducing gun violence.
