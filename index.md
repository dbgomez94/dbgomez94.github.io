I'm a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer passionate about applying the tools of Machine Learning for Social Good.

**I have a diverse set of experiences and skills.** Though trained as an Aerospace Engineer, over the last 4 years, I've transitioned into the field of Computer Science and Machine Learning.

- *AE Background:* I received my BS and (first) MS degree from Georgia Tech in Aerospace Engineering where I worked in the High-Power Electric Propulsion Lab under the advisory of Dr. Mitchell Walker and was funding by a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship. Upon graduating, I spent a year in industry at Busek Space Propulsion and Systems.

- *ML Background:* After a year in the aerospace industry, I returned to GT to pursue what will be my second MS degree, this time in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning. I work in the Social Dynamics and Well-Being Lab under the advisory of Dr. Munmun De Choudhury where my research involves developing machine and deep learning models to understand the relationship between social media and adolescent mental health. 

**I'm currently seeking employment as a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer with the long-term goal of developing models and technologies with positive societal impact.**
