In the Fall of 2019, I was obtaining my Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering, when I took a course in taught by Dr. Joseph Homer Saleh -- a great man who would become an important influence in my life. The course was called Accident Causation and System Safety. In it, as what I can only surmise was bonus material, our professor included four lectures on Applied Linear Regression. At the end of this course was an open-ended term project with the only requirements that (1) it use the material covered in the course and (2) it seeks to promote the welfare of humanity.

I formed a team consisting of my fellow AE colleagues: [Jose Sanchez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jose-c-sanchez/), [Danial Baum](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-baum-ae/), and [Abdulrahman Shurayma](), and we pursued a topic that was close to my heart: suicide. Specifically, we sought to investigate the relationship between firearms and suicide. Our preliminary analysis revealed that, in 2017, more than 47,000 Americans died by suicide (this number is closer to 50,000 in 2022); that is roughly 129 suicides per day or one suicide every 11 minutes. It's estimated that more than 90% of suicide attempts are committed using non-firearm methods (e.g., suffocation, poisoning, cutting, etc.). **Only about 10% of attempters use a gun; however, firearm-suicides account for over half of all suicide fatalities** -- nearly 24,000 in 2017 (or 27,000 in 2022)
