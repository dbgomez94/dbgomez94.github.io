My name is David Gomez. I'm a 2nd year PhD student at Georgia Tech. I'm 27 years old. I have one beautiful wife, four sisters, and a sweet puppy named Lucy. 

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
