**Research and Development Engineer** \
*Busek Space Propulsion Systems, Inc., Natick, MA* \
*August 2020 - August 2021*
- Performed tests, experiments, and data analyses for the qualification of electric propulsion devices.
- Built LabVIEW applications to automate the acquisition of Hall thruster magnetic field profiles and oscilloscope measurements that reduced acquisition time by 25%.
- Utilized linear regression and inverse prediction intervals to implement a standardized uncertainty analysis procedure in MATLAB for electric propulsion thrust stands.

**Electric Progulsion Graduate Intern** \
*NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA* \
*May - August 2020*
- Utilized linear regression and inverse prediction intervals to construct a theorectical framework for uncertainty analysis of electric propulsion thrust stands. 
- Conceptualized a modernized design for high-power thrust stands using SolidWorks.

**Electric Progulsion Intern (x2)** \
*NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Pasadena, CA * \
*May - August 2018, 2019* 
- Build a custom LabVIEW application from scratch to automate the control and data acquisition of 20 devices and over 200 channels for laboratory testing of electric propulsion devices.
- Improved the hardware response time and sampling rate by 1 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively.
