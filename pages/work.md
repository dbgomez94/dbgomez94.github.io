## Work Experience

### Research and Development Engineer
#### Busek Space Propulsion Systems, Inc. - Natick, MA
August 2020 - August 2021
- Performed tests, experiments, and data analyses for the qualification of electric propulsion devices.
- Built LabVIEW applications to automate the acquisition of Hall thruster magnetic field profiles and oscilloscope measurements that reduced acquisition time by 25%.
- Utilized linear regression and inverse prediction intervals to implement a standardized uncertainty analysis procedure in MATLAB for electric propulsion thrust stands.

### Electric Progulsion Intern (x3)
#### NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory - Pasadena, CA 
May - August 2018, 2019, 2020
- [2020] Utilized linear regression and inverse prediction intervals to construct a theorectical framework for uncertainty analysis of  electric propulsion thrust stands.
- [2018, 2019] Built a custom LabVIEW application for electric thruster testing that synchronized the control and data acquisition of 20 devices and over 200 channels. and improved the hardware response time and sampling rate by 1 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively.
