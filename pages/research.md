# Research Experience

**Graduate Research Assistant** \
*Social Dynamics and Wellbeing Lab* \
*Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA* \
*August 2022 - May 2024*
- Utilized social media data and the tools of machine learning to conduct several studies surrounding individual and group mental health.
- Collected Twitter (now X) data from Twitter's APIs and utilized unsupervised timeseries clustering techniques to identify common temporal language patterns in tweets following a dislcosure of suicidality.
- Collected Reddit data from Reddit's APIs and utilized the Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning to differentiate language use across r/depression, r/suicidewatch, and r/stopselfharm.
- Collected Twitter data from Twitter's APIs and utilized controlled linear regression models and statistical tests to argue that Americans have become desensitized to mass shootings.

**Graduate Research Assistant** \
*Space Systems Design Lab* \
*Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA* \
*August 2021 - May 2022*
- Developed a Monte-Carlo value analysis of High-Throughput Satellites that identified value levers, tradeoffs, and implications for operators and investors.
- Conducted a reliability analysis of CubeSat systems that identified the most critical subsystems and failure modes for future design improvements.

**Graduate Research Assistant** \
*High Power Electric Propulsion Lab* \
*Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA* \
*August 2018 - May 2020* 
- Developed a 1-D simulation of an electric propulsion Hall thruster in MATLAB using second-order upwind schemes to evolve kinetic transport equations to examine the effect of an elongated ionization chamber on thruster performance.

**Undergraduate Research Assistant** \
*High Power Electric Propulsion Lab* \
*Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA* \
*August 2017 - May 2018*
- Utilized LabVIEW to develop an automated mass flow calibration system for Hall thrusters vacuum chamber testing incorporating 3 mass flow controllers, 2 pressure transducers, and 1 thermocouple, and 3 solenoid valves.
