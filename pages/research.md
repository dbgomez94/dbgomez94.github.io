## Research Experience

2022-2024 \
**Graduate Research Assistant** \
School of Interactive Computing \
[**Georgia Institute of Technology**](https://www.gatech.edu/), Atlanta, GA \
Advisor: [Munmun De Choudhury](http://www.munmund.net/index.html) \
Member of the [Social Dynamics and Well-Being Lab](https://socweb.cc.gatech.edu/)
- Utilized social media data and the tools of machine learning to conduct several studies surrounding individual and group mental health.
- Collected Twitter (now X) data from Twitter's APIs and utilized unsupervised timeseries clustering techniques to identify common temporal language patterns in tweets following a dislcosure of suicidality.
- Collected Reddit data from Reddit's APIs and utilized the Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning to differentiate language use across r/depression, r/suicidewatch, and r/stopselfharm via model interpretability techniques including SHAPley values.
- Collected Twitter data from Twitter's APIs and utilized supervised learning techniques and hypothesis tests to argue that Americans have become desensitized to mass shootings.

2021-2022 \
**Graduate Research Assistant** \
School of Aerospace Engineering \
[**Georgia Institute of Technology**](https://www.gatech.edu/), Atlanta, GA \
Advisor: [**Dr. Joseph Homer Saleh**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-homer-saleh-8b8773119/) \
Member of the [Space Systems Design Lab](https://ssdl.gatech.edu/)
- Leveraged statistical learning and deep learning to improve state-of-the-art gun ownership proxy from linear R2 of 61% to 94%.
- Developed a Monte-Carlo value analysis of High-Throughput Satellites that identified value levers, tradeoffs, and implications for operators and investors.
- Conducted a reliability analysis of CubeSat systems that identified the most critical subsystems and failure modes for future design improvements.

2018-2020 \
**Graduate Research Assistant** \
School of Aerospace Engineering \
[**Georgia Institute of Technology**](https://www.gatech.edu/), Atlanta, GA \
Advisor: [**Dr. Mitchell L.R. Walker**](https://mwalker.gatech.edu/) \
Member of the [High-Power Electric Propulsion Laboratory](https://hpepl.ae.gatech.edu/)
- Developed a 1-D simulation of an electric propulsion Hall thruster in MATLAB using second-order upwind schemes to evolve kinetic transport equations to examine the effect of an elongated ionization chamber on thruster performance.
