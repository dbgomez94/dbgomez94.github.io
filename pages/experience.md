## Research Experience

2022-2024 \
**Graduate Research Assistant** \
School of Interactive Computing \
[Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/), Atlanta, GA \
Member of the [Social Dynamics and Well-Being Lab](https://socweb.cc.gatech.edu/)
- Utilized social media data and the tools of machine learning to conduct several studies surrounding individual and group mental health.
- Collected Twitter (now X) data from Twitter's APIs and utilized unsupervised timeseries clustering techniques to identify common temporal language patterns in tweets following a disclosure of suicidality.
- Collected Reddit data from Reddit's APIs and utilized the Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning to differentiate language use across r/depression, r/suicidewatch, and r/stopselfharm via model interpretability techniques including SHAPley values.
- Collected Twitter data from Twitter's APIs and utilized statistical learning techniques including linear regression and hypothesis testing to argue that Americans have become desensitized to mass shootings.
