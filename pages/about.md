# David B. Gomez
I have a diverse set of experiences and skills. Though trained as an Aerospace Engineer, over the last 4 years, I've transitioned into the field of Computer Science and Machine Learning.

- *AE Background:* I received my BS and (first) MS degree from Georgia Tech in Aerospace Engineering where I worked in the High-Power Electric Propulsion Lab under the advisory of Dr. Mitchell Walker and was funded by a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship. Upon graduating, I spent a year in industry at Busek Space Propulsion and Systems.

- *ML Background:* After a year in the aerospace industry, I returned to GT to pursue what will be my second MS degree, this time in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning. I work in the Social Dynamics and Well-Being Lab under the advisory of Dr. Munmun De Choudhury where **my research involves developing machine and deep learning models to understand the relationship between social media and adolescent mental health**.
