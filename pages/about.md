# David B. Gomez

I have a diverse set of experiences and skills. Though trained in Aerospace Engineering (AE), over the last 4 years, I've transitioned into the field of Machine Learning (ML). I've developed a passion for using the tools of ML to better understand mental health, with a particular focus on suicidality.

## Aerospace Background 

I received my BS and (first) MS degree from Georgia Tech in Aerospace Engineering where I worked in the High-Power Electric Propulsion Lab under the advisory of Dr. Mitchell Walker and was funded by a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship. I completed three internships at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the Electric Propulsion Group, where I developed software to test Hall Effect thrusters to be used onboard the Lunar Gateway as part of NASA's Artemis mission. Upon graduating, I spent a year in industry at Busek Space Propulsion and Systems where I supported the testing and qualification of electric propulsion devices for spaceflight.

## Transition from AE to ML

During my AE BS and MS degrees, spurred by personal experiences, I became acutely aware of the tremendous burden that suicidality constitutes in our societies. At the same time, I was introduced to the field of machine learning in the form of four lectures on applied linear regression. In what began as a [course project](https://dbgomez94.github.io/2019-12-01-challenging-the-inevitability-of-suicide/) investigating the relationship between gun laws and suicide rates in the United States, later evolved into a strong desire to leverage the tools of machine learning for social good.

## Machine Learning Background

After a year in the aerospace industry, I returned to GT to pursue what will be my second MS degree, this time in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning. I work in the Social Dynamics and Well-Being Lab where I leverage machine and deep learning techniques to study various topics at the intersection of social media and mental health. I'm particularly interested in combatting the burden of suicide.
