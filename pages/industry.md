## Industry Experience

2020-2021 \
**Research and Development Engineer** \
[*Busek Space Propulsion and Systems*](https://www.busek.com/), Natick, MA \
[Electric Propulsion Group](https://www.busek.com/) \
Mentor(s): [Surjeet Paintal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/surjeet-paintal-5bba6a/), [Samual Sawyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-sawyer-b8ab69a4/)
- Performed tests, experiments, and data analyses for the qualification of electric propulsion devices.
- Built LabVIEW applications to automate the acquisition of Hall thruster magnetic field profiles and oscilloscope measurements that reduced acquisition time by 25%.
- Utilized linear regression and inverse prediction intervals to implement a standardized uncertainty analysis procedure in MATLAB for electric propulsion thrust stands.

Summer 2020 \
**Graduate Electric Propulsion Intern** \
