I received my BS and MS in Aerospace Engineering from Georgia Tech where I worked in the [High-Power Electric Propulsion Lab](https://hpepl.ae.gatech.edu/) under the mentorship of [Dr. Mitchell Walker](https://mwalker.gatech.edu/) where my work was supported by a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship. Upon graduating, I spent a year in the aerospace industry as a R&D Engineer at [Busek Space Propulsion and Systems](https://www.busek.com/). This era was sprinkled with a medley of [passion projects](https://dbgomez94.github.io/pages/projects/) involving the tools of statistical/machine learning in the public health domain. This side work left a deep impression on my heart, so much so that I returned to GT to pursue this MSCS degree with the aim of transitioning to the field of Machine Learning for Social Good.
